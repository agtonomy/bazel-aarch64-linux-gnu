# ld (at least built and configured the way Ubuntu does,) doesn't work well with bazel's
# sandbox symlinks, so resolve the actual path where libraries reside:
libc_realpath="$(realpath "$(find . -name libc.so.6 | head -n1)")" # This is the actual path to libc
# Remove the filename and usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib to get the sysroot:
sysroot="$(realpath "$(dirname "$libc_realpath")/../../../")"

# Due to https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/16222 this is the only spot we can add
# the --no-as-needed ld flag to make the final binary list every shared library provided on
# the command line as DT_NEEDED, which is required to make ld.so use the RPATH entries
# to find those libraries:

./external/ubuntu-22.04-aarch64-native/usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc-11 -Wl,--no-as-needed "$@" --sysroot="$sysroot"
